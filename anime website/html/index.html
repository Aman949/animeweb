            <p class="text">Everyone has been wondering when Attack on Titan’s Final Season would get its Part 2, and now we finally have a release date for the upcoming last batch of episodes, closing down the epic series.
 
             That would be January 9, 2022, around 9 months after the Part 1 finale aired in 2021.
             
            <span class="readmore"> Season 4 had 16 episodes in the first part of the season, but we do not yet know how many episodes are planned for Part 2 of Attack on Titan’s last season here, as that has not been announced, even though the date now has. It’s supposed to close out the rest of the manga, which ended this past June, but that’s a lot of ground to cover, so we could be in for a lengthy string of episodes.
             
             Before the Part 2 release date arrives, Attack on Titan is airing six episodes that will act as a recap of the previous 75 episodes, summarizing the story so far. Those are airing starting on October 25 in Japan, but no word on a US release date yet.</span></p>
